// ─── @import discovery (issue #73) ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The CSS watcher fires on a stat change of the main stylesheet, but
// `@import`-referenced files live wherever the user wants them — theme
// managers like tinty keep color-scheme CSS under `~/.local/share/...`
// and reference it from `~/.config/.../style.css`. Without this, the
// user changes their color scheme, the imported file changes on disk,
// and the dock looks stale until the user manually touches their main
// CSS file. Parsing `@import` directives lets us watch the target files
// too, at the cost of a tiny CSS mini-parser below.
//
// The parser is lenient: anything it can't recognize is silently
// skipped, which means we might miss an exotic `@import` form (we don't
// hot-reload the target) but we never crash or corrupt user CSS. Real
// CSS evaluation is still done by GTK via `load_from_path`; we only
// peek at the file to find out what else to watch.

/// Walks the `@import` graph rooted at the main CSS and returns the
/// canonical paths of every reachable file that currently exists on
/// disk. Safe against read failure at any node (skip-and-continue),
/// and terminates cleanly on cycles (each canonical path is visited
/// at most once) and on pathologically deep chains
/// (capped at `MAX_IMPORT_GRAPH_SIZE` nodes with a warning).
///
/// The main CSS itself is not in the returned vec — the caller
/// (`watch_css`) already tracks it separately as the root.
///
/// Canonical paths are used for dedup (`visited`) and for the returned
/// set (so the notify event match — which reports canonical paths —
/// works), but the *as-referenced* form of each file is what drives
/// the next hop's relative-import resolution. GTK4 resolves relative
/// `@import` paths against the directory of the path it was *given*,
